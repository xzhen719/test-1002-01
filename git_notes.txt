一個專案對應一個repository
staged area類似暫存區
git add . = git add -A (兩個都是提交全部檔案到staging area的意思)
git commit -m (committing the file to repo, -m means with message.)

reg git push, a destination is required (usaully ur github repo)
git remote add <name> <url>

<url>: url of the remote repo u r pushing into
<name>: just an alias of the remote repo.

by setting the name you want have to type in the url everytime. cuz a name has been given to the remote repo now.

=> git push <name>

when cloning from remote repo,          

Remote Repository (GitHub)
          -----------------------
          URL: https://github.com/xzhen719/test-1002-01.git
          Remote name: origin (automatically sets "origin" as default name)
                 ▲
                 │  git push / git pull
                 │
Local Repository (Your Computer)
-------------------------------
Folder name: test-1002-01   <-- this is your "local repo name"
.git/ folder: stores all Git info (commits, branches, remotes, etc.)
Current branch: main        <-- where you make commits



Workflow Example:
1. Edit files in your local repo
2. git add <files>
3. git commit -m "message"
4. git push origin main     <-- send changes to remote
5. git pull origin main     <-- get new changes from remote
