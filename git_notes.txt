一個專案對應一個repository
staged area類似暫存區
git add . = git add -A (兩個都是提交全部檔案到staging area的意思)
git commit -m (committing the file to repo, -m means with message.)

reg git push, a destination is required (usaully ur github repo)
git remote add <name> <url>

<url>: url of the remote repo u r pushing into
<name>: just an alias of the remote repo.

by setting the name you want have to type in the url everytime. cuz a name has been given to the remote repo now.

=> git push <name>
